## Start the Application

As application uses Topcoder authorization we have to run it on the one of allowed domains. For development purposes we can use `local.topcoder-dev.com:3000`. So before run we have to add into `hosts` file the line `127.0.0.1 local.topcoder-dev.com`. Be aware, that we also have to run on the port `3000` to be able to authorize when run locally.

Simply execute the following command to start the app in development mode (with browsersync)
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```
Application will be hosted and running at http://local.topcoder-dev.com:3000.

## Execute E2E Tests

Before executing the end-to-end (e2e) protractor tests, these environment variables should be set:

| Name | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BUILD_ENV | Deployment configuration to be tested by e2e tests. | See [Configuration](#configuration) for possible values. Defaults to `dev`. |
| TEST_PORT | Port from which to serve the app for e2e tests. | Defaults to `3000`. |

```npm test```

## Fallback instruction in case the npm scripts fail

### Install global dependencies

```npm install -g gulp@3.8.10```

### Install project dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Start the Application

```gulp serve```

### Build the Application
